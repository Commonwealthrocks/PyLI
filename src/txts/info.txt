TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

CRYPTOGRAPHIC DETAILS:
- Algorithm: AES-256-GCM (authenticated encryption)
- Key derivation: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
- Iterations: 1,000,000 (default)
- Salt size: 16 bytes (random per file)
- Nonce size: 12 bytes (random per file)
- Chunk size: 3MB (3 * 1024 * 1024)

FILE FORMAT STRUCTURE:
- Magic number: "PYLI\x00" (5 bytes)
- Format version: 4 (1 byte)
- Algorithm ID: 1 (1 byte)  
- KDF ID: 1 (1 byte)
- Iterations: 1,000,000 (4 bytes)
- Salt size: 4 (16 bytes)
- Salt: random 16 bytes
- Nonce: random 12 bytes
- Extension Length: variable (4 bytes)
- Encrypted extension: variable length
- Encrypted file data: variable length

SECURITY NOTES:
- Extension is encrypted to hide file type
- Each file gets unique salt and nonce
- GCM provides authentication (detects tampering)
- Password never stored, only derived key used
- Memory cleared after key derivation (best effort with C if on)

PERFORMANCE:
- Multi threaded GUI (crypto runs in background)
- Progress tracking for large files
- Batch processing support
- Memory efficient chunked processing

BUILD INFO:
- Language: Python 3.12, C
- GUI framework: PySide6 (QtFramework)
- Crypto library: cryptography (Rust / C based)
- Compiler: Nuitka (when distributed)
- Platform: Windows based, MIGHT work on Linux/Mac
- Build version: 0-6-0-9-2-0-2-5
- Version: 0.6a

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
- No file shredding after encryption
- Progress reporting could be more accurate
- No key file support (password only)
- Single threaded crypto operations (multi-threading sounds un-fun?)
