LEGAL SHIT (because lawyers exist)

This software is provided "AS IS", meaning if it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.
Use it however the hell you want, but don't come crying to me if:

- Your files get corrupted
- Your computer catches fire (though that's probably unrelated)
- You forget your password, this is AES we are talking about
- You edit the encrypted files, checksum will not take that nicely
- Your cat walks across the keyboard and corrupts somethin'
- The software decides to derp mid encryption
- You accidentally encrypt your entire C:\ drive (trust me it's possible if you try hard enough)
- Your files get possessed
- The heat death of the universe occurs while processing (unlikely of happening tho)

By using this software, you acknowledge that:
- You're a competent human being who can handle consequences
- The developer (yes, me) isn't your personal IT support
- Strong encryption means REALLY STRONG, no backsies if you lose the key
- If you're using this for illegal stuff, be my guest. But I won't be your's.
- Reading this disclaimer means you actually care about legal stuff (weird flex but ok)
- The laws of physics still apply, unfortunately

IMPORTANT CRYPTO NOTES:
- AES-GCM is no joke, forget your password and your data is gone unless you specialize in this kinda shit
- This uses proper key derivation (PBKDF2 with 1,000,000 iterations as default)
- Your encrypted files are YOUR responsibility
- Keep your original file somewhere safe JUST in case
- I'm not a cybersecurity expert, but on the bright side I'm not using ROT13!!

TECHNICAL DISCLAIMERS:
- Not tested on quantum computers (yet)
- May not work properly during solar flares
- Performance may vary based on your hamster wheel setup
- Side effects may include: increased paranoia about file security
- Not compatible with time travel (trust me, I tried)

Bottom line: Use this with caution, perhaps got a concern or bug?
e-mail: still no lol <3
